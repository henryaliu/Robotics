# Robotics Progress - Month 1

Focused on fundamentals for integrating AI with robotics. Covered kinematics, ROS2, simulation, computer vision, and basic LLM control.

## Areas Covered

- Robotics kinematics and control (Modern Robotics Ch 1–5)
- ROS2 Humble install and basic simulation
- Built 2–3 DOF arm in Gazebo/RViz
- OpenCV for object detection and tracking
- Ran LLMs for simple robot task planning (mock commands)

## Deliverables

- ROS2 robot arm sim
- OpenCV perception demo (color/shape tracking)
- LLM script generating basic control plans
